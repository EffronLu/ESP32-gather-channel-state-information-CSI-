This is currently NOT working

The goal is to send a NULL data frame to to the AP with a fixed rate (802.11n) so it will respond with an "ack" at 802.11n also (which will contain a CSI preamble).

This probably will work, it "just" need to incorporate the fixed rate private function and the NULL data frame. This should be quick, ping me if you need this quickly.
