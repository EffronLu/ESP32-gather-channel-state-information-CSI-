### Info 

Big thanks to Noel Hiller to have shared this code
This is currently WORKING but NOT TESTED

### How to use 

Upload the client on one board and the server on another board. 

### Goal 

This sends UDP packets from one board to the other and triggers CSI callback.

### Warning

You probably want to customice the MAC filters so you don't receive frames from surrounding AP.

### Result example
