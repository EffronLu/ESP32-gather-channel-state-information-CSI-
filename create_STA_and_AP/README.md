This is currently NOT fully working

The goal is to create an AP and a STA, both using an ESP32 ( ESP32 AP <-> ESP32 STA), in order to have a stable connection with CSI already filtered (no promiscuous mode required)
You can help by sharing this code with me if you already have it. 
Else if you can wait a few week it should be there (drop me a mail if not)
