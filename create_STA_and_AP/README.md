### Info 

Big thanks to Noel Hiller to have shared this code
This is currently WORKING and tested (still some improvements to be made)

### How to use 

Upload the client on one board and the server on another board. Monitor the client and wait for CSI.

### Goal 

This sends UDP packets from one board to the other and triggers CSI callback.

### Warning

You probably want to customice the MAC filters so you don't receive frames from surrounding AP.

### Result example
